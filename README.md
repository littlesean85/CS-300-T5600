# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  In this course we were tasked with working with ABCU to create a program that would allow sudents to view all the courses for the Computer Science program in a sorted order of their choosing. In this we worked with Vector Sorting, Hash Tables, Linked Lists and Binary Tree Searches and ran an analysis to see which would be the better sorting option for the program.   We wre trying to get the informaiton sorted and organized so it was easy to see what needed to be completed for the completion of the degree. 
  
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  THis was a pporached very analytically for me.  While learning new things about the sorting options.  I had to think to myself first which I think would be the better option because I would be looking at this type of program potentially.  THe program was deisgned to make things easeir and if I want things easier, I would want to have the easiest to view sortng feature headlined in the program.  It is important to understand data structures, so you know how things will be displayed and how data will be collected while the program is running.  If you dont have a basic understanding ofdata structures you would be going into this blindly. 


# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  The C++ language is still very new to me, so I did encounter many roadblocks while going through everything, but SNHU sets you up for success in everything you do, so I was able to work past them.  THey have this lovely little thing called drop in tutoring and it is AMAZING.  I use it when I have trouble wrapping my head around a certain concept and they will help me work through the problem, and make sure I am going in the right direction, and if I get off they simply lead me back to the right place.  They are there to help and they really do help. 


# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  This project really helped me realize how important it is to break things down into little sections instead of trying to work everything out all at once in on big project.  By having the milestnes lead up to the big project I was able to incorporate those parts which made the final production of the project fairly simple because the hard work had already been done and it only had to be put into paper at that point.   I have a tendency to work on everything at once and it causes me to get lost in my work and sometimes it is very frustrating, so the eay this was done wiht breaking everything apart made it easier for me, ad I will continue to work on thqt because I understand some codes in the future might get extrememly long. 


# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  This project really helped me develope my skills in C++, I am still learning and I feel that it could be a lot better, but it will come as I practice more.  I am still very Novice with it, so it needs work but this class really helped me with understanding where to start with it, and breaking things apart.  Also gave me practice with spacing when wiritng to leave room for comments and to allow for better readability.
